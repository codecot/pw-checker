# pw-checker — Your Local AI-Powered Password Security Assistant

**pw-checker** is an intelligent CLI tool that helps you detect weak or compromised passwords, assess real-world risk, and get actionable, personalized recommendations — without ever sending your data to the cloud.

## 💡 What Makes pw-checker Unique?

### ✅ Local-First Security

All checks and analysis run entirely on your machine. No password or account data leaves your device.

### 🧠 Risk Intelligence

Goes beyond breach checks. Calculates a risk score (0–100) using real signals like compromise status, password strength, category, reuse, and usage frequency.

### 📋 Actionable Prioritization

Don't just get told what's wrong — get prioritized suggestions: what to fix first and why.

### 📄 Audit Reports

Generate PDF security reports, export to CSV, or browse in a rich CLI with filters and color-coded output.
